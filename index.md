## Introduction

Hello! My name is Polina Yordanova and this is my final assignment in building webpages using GitHub Pages.
  
I am a doctoral student in the Department of Languages at the University of Helsinki and I am interested in finding out how Ancient Greek word order has changed during the language's *long* history. In order to learn more about it, I look at papyri found in Egypt in the Ptolemaic period and make syntactic "trees" out of their sentences, which I then query for peculiar word order structures and try to find patterns and the possible underlying reasons for them.  

I still have a long way to go, but I hope I can find something interesting and useful!
